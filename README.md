A Home Assistant custom component for reading air quality data from the EPA Victoria (Australia) Environment Monitoring API

In order to use this integration, you will need to sign up to the [EPA Developer portal](https://portal.api.epa.vic.gov.au/).

Once you have signed up and have a log in, go to the [Environment Monitoring](https://portal.api.epa.vic.gov.au/product#product=environment-monitoring) page, select a name (such as home-assistant) for your new subscription, and hit `subscribe`.

This will create a new subscription, with a Primary and Secondary key.  You only need one key for the API, and you can return to your [profile page](https://portal.api.epa.vic.gov.au/profile) at any time to review the keys, so there is no need to record them in your password manager (provided, of course, that you have recorded your login to to the EPA Developer portal in your password manager).

Once you have subscribed, you can set up this integration.

First it will prompt you for your API Key:

Then, after a few moments, while it is finding all EPA monitoring stations, and listing them with the closest stations to you listed first, it will prompt you to choose a station.  The closest station to you should be listed at the top of the list, but you may prefer to choose another station, especially if you know that is where the prevailing wind blows from.

If you drop the images (`good-aqi.png`, `fair-aqi.png`, `poor-aqi.png`, `verypoor-aql.png`, and `extremelypoor-aqi.png`) into your `www` directory (or create it, if required), the `sample-card.yaml` will create the sample below.

Sometimes sensors go off line: example of Melbourne CBD Sensor when it goes offline - integration switches to 24 Hour sensor, and shows the Data source as 24HR_AV

Inspired by [@loryanstrant](https://github.com/loryanstrant) who published [this article](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2023/07/23/track-air-quality-with-home-assistant-and-epa-data/) that helped me track air quality in HA, and created the first repo for this project.

Thanks to @autoSteve who provided much of the python knowledge and assistance over at [HA Solcast PV Solar Forecast Integration](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) and to @bremor and @Makin-Things who provided inspiration (and a model to steal for a cloud polling integration) with their fantastic [BoM integration](https://github.com/bremor/bureau_of_meteorology)

I am considering whether future releases will support multiple installs so you can monitor multiple locations: currently the integration doesn't prevent multiple installs, but errors out on second and subsequent installs.

Current release v0.4.3 allows selecting Air Quality monitoring station from a list sorted by distance from your Home Assistant location.

If you change the location, subsequent list updates might be sorted based on distance from the currently selected location ðŸ¤£
